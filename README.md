<h1>CS 340 - Client / Server Development</h1>

  Welcome to the repository for the various projects from my CS 340 Client / Server Development class at SNHU Online! 
  This class was by far my most challenging and most rewarding to date, and honestly was the most fun as well. Working with databases really brought the whole CS Program back around to relevance with the modern world. Just about every interaction we have with the internet revolves around databases of some kind. Be it logging into our social media or bank accounts, shopping on our favorite retail site, or accessing research information, more often than not a database is working behind the scenes. To access that database, there is a CRUD module developed on the backend, and of course a front end that consists of a UI to make navigating all of the information much easier. This class covered all three parts.
  
  Feel free to browse my code and check out the various applications that I developed during the semester. The culmination of my learning can be found in the  <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_340_Client_Server_Development/blob/main/Python%20Mongo%20Tests/ModuleSixMilestone_AAC.py" target="_blank">Final Project file</a>. For more information about the project, see the 
  <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_330_Projects/tree/master/7-1 Final Project - A 3D Scene/Documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>. The README file will give you information about how to install and run the program (Python is required), and you'll want to set up a Mongodb server either locally or on Atlas (check out my YouTube channel for information on how to do that).
